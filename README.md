# U.S-Election-2016-Debate-Transcript-analysis-System
This project develops an interesting parallelism between Hillary’s and Trump’s debate transcripts. In addition, the project looks at what kinds of different words have been used, how often have they been used, and how does each candidate’s’ transcript compare with that of the other candidate. In order to answer this questions, we have developed a visualization mechanism whereby we create a word cloud to display the most used words with different font sizes scaled by their frequency. Each candidate has three-word clouds corresponding to the three debates. The user gets to pick a debate and observe the similarities and differences between the two candidate’s word clouds. On top of that, the user could also, simultaneously, notice the similarities and differences among word the clouds of each candidate.
